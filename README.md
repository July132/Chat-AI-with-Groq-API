![Groq Logo](https://cdn.asp.events/CLIENT_Informa__AADDE28D_5056_B739_5481D63BF875B0DF/sites/ai-summit-NY-2022/media/libraries/exhibitors/0b84f0a6-3bbd-11ee-bff906bd0f937899-cover-image.png/fit-in/1500x9999/filters:no_upscale())

Welcome, Students! üêç In this project, you'll create a chat application that utilizes the Groq API to generate AI responses. Instead of a graphical interface, you will modify the existing code to run directly in your IDE and display responses in the console. Let's dive in! üöÄ

### Purpose of This Project

By completing this project, you will:
- Learn how to connect to and use an external API in Python.
- Replace a GUI with console-based interaction.
- Improve your understanding of error handling in API requests.
- Work with your own API key, gaining hands-on experience in API integration.

### Get Your API Key

To use the Groq API, you need an API key. Follow these steps:
1. Go to the [Groq website](https://groq.com/) and sign up for an account. üåê
2. Once registered, retrieve your API key from your account dashboard. Keep this key secure!
